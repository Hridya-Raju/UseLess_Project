### Project Description
Our site The Game Hive offers a game called the Rocket. It is game similar to the flappy bird game. What makes this game different is that the levels in this game are very difficult to pass.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes you might feel like you are too happy and then you might get sad about that. We have developed a game to provide a solution just for this

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
When you feel too relieved or  too happy, you can play this game to not feel that anymore. This game makes you feel stressed and anxious.
